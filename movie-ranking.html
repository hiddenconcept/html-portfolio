     The Best Movies Of All Time According TO:
     Myles
</h1>

<h1> My top 3 movies of all-time:</h1>
<hr />
<h1>Goodfellas:</h1>
<p> This is my favourite movie of all time, good laughs, good mafia movie, is overal a good movie and based on true events. </p>
 
<h1>Casino:</h1>
<p>Another cult classic mafia film, with almost the exact same core cast as in the movie above this one.</p>

<h1>Eight Crazy Nights</h1>
<p>Thought we were keeping the same trend as the last 2 movies? 
Think again! With one of the best movie actors of all time, or atleast for this current generation of still being alive.
With this also being a Christmas movie, it is also a very good one. 
A well deserved meaning of never take anything for granted.
And dont let things ruin your shine onto others because things didnt happen to go your way.
Ontop of being one of the best actors of all time In my opinion
He also voiced well over 8 characters in this film.
Wonderul.
